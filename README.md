## Description         
Freelance web developers are often stressed to finish projects for a diverse array of clients. These projects sometimes require logos that need to be created quickly, and without the hiring (and waiting on!) of a graphic designer. 

The SVG-Logo-Maker command-line application was built to solve that problem for developers! While creating this project I learned about setting up robust jest tests and using multiple scripts to organize and complete functions to operate the application. Although this app only needs a few answers from users, the possibilities for logo creating are vast. 

## Installation 🖥️
To install the SVG Logo-Maker git clone the repository onto a local environment and run the command "npm i" in the terminal. Then run the command "node index.js" and answer the prompts as they appear in the terminal. If you have certain hexadecimal codes in mind for your logo, have them handy!

The SVG-Logo-Maker features a jest test that tests against each shape template to make sure the SVG outputted includes the correct text, text color, and shape color as dictated in the generate svg function.
